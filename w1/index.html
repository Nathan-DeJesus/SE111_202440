        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Welcome, as you know I'm Nathan DeJesus! After graduating from high school I attended NEIT for the Cyber Security program after mostly doing the subject during my time in high school. I am a very sleep deprived person so you'll see me dozing off here and there but other than that i am very attentive! I work at showcase cinimas and other than that my hobbies are gameing, driving and mostly being sleep deprived! thank you for reading!
