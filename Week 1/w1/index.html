    <h1>Nathan DeJesus</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Nathan and I come from <b>West Warwick</b>! I am a proud owner of <i>6 pets</i> and my favorite thing to do is play <u>video games</u>! Some of my hobbies are cosplaying, traveling, and building. I used to go to comic con back then but never had the time to go recently due to both work and college but I have hopes that I'll be able to go again soon! I already have an internship ready for me when i get my associate's degree which only makes me work harder so I can leave my current job and work there. </p>
